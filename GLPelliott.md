Following a meeting with Alex (who did a game of black jack) we each decided to comment our functions, looking for cleaner ways to achieve the same outcomes and reduce unnecessary noise within the file.

Given my project had over 10 functions it was importing to keep naming clear and consistent and explain the precuror(s) and dependents.

The variable names also had to be meaningful, otherwise things woudl get very confusing and that wasn't going to help anyone.


Also, a lesson I learned for future projects was to avoid global vaiables as they were a big mess.

Thanks, Elliott
