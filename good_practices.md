## Topics to debate 


### Variable naming.

PEP8 will be implement as the code syntax. 
snake_case will be used for the development of the code and not to violate PEP8.

### Function naming.

Function names will include a verb about the scope of the function. 
snake_case as well in functions.
Functions will include a description to help the understanding.

numpy

Other libraries...


### Community conventions.

### Other (git, ...)

Functions will be defined in a different script and will be splitted depending on the application: 

- Functions for data cleaning
- Functions for web scrapping

Classes won't be defined unless they are extremely necessary and if we know how to do. 

Alberto is the responsible for forking the repo and allowing Josep and Ingrid to collaborate in the repository and to be able to clone it.
